This is the home for my visual argument project, where I have created a poster that is informative of Global Warming issues. My project consists of four images in each corner all pretaining to a different issue Earth is facing, air pollution, deforestation/ habitat loss, ocean pollution, and melting ice caps. In the two bottom corners it focuses on how animals are suffering loss of biodiversity due to plastic waste pollution and deforestation for urban production and agriculture. I am emphasized how farm animals are taking over land previously inhabitated by game animals by blacking out the images of the deer and making the chickens and deer in more abuundance and in color. I have also done similar symbolims for ocean animals blacking out the fish to imply that pollution is taking away lives of ocean life. To emphasize the urgency of the global warming issue I have highlighted the word WARN in warming to show how these effects are our warning as a species to make changes fast before irreparable damade is done. This is currently my first draft of this project and have posted both a xcf and pdf of the project that is located in my visual argument rego.
